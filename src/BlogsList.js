      title: 'Future of Programming',
      author:"MIT Technology Review",
      description: 'The future of computing feels more tenuous, harder to map in a sea of information and disruption. That is not to say that predictions are futile, or that those who build and use technology have no control over where computing goes next. To the contrary: history abounds with examples of individual and collective action that altered social and political outcomes. But there are limits to the power of technology to overcome earthbound realities of politics, markets, and culture. '

      title: 'The Future of Programming in a Generative AI World',
      author:"Dr. Gleb Tsipursky",
      description: "Imagine, if you will, a time when writing code was an arduous task, limited only to those with years of education and experience. A time when, much like a painter creating a masterpiece, each line of code had to be meticulously crafted and curated. Then, like a magic spell, generative AI appeared on the scene and turned the world of programming on its head, as I describe in my book on this topic."
