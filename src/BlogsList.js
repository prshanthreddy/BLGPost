      description: 'The future of computing feels more tenuous, harder to map in a sea of information and disruption. That is not to say that predictions are futile, or that those who build and use technology have no control over where computing goes next.

But there are limits to the power of technology to overcome earthbound realities of politics, markets, and culture. '
